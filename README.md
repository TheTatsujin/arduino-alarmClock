# Arduino AT Mega 2560 Project: External I/O Devices and I²C Communication

## Overview
This project was developed as the final assignment for the **Peripherals and Interfaces** course during my CS degree. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with external I/O devices and their communication with the microcontroller through an I²C Bus interface.

> **Note:** This project was tested using [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/), a simulation tool for electronic circuits.


## Project Goals
-   Apply theoretical knowledge about the input/output system of a computer system.
-   Understand the practical aspects of the operation of certain basic components in external devices.
-   Integrate and connect basic components to make a device that meets a specific functionality.
-   Analyze, design, and implement control software for the proper operation of the device.
-   Verify and debug for proper functioning of the hardware-software integration. Redesign if necessary.
